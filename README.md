# Columbo: Backend

All documentation regarding this application is in [the wiki](https://github.com/iw-dbti-2016/columbo-backend/wiki).

An introduction is provided in the wiki Home, and to get up and running, the 'getting started'-section and it's subpages are helpful. Other items go into further detail about authentication, the API or terminology.

The API reference is particularly handy to lookup the available endpoints and the guaranteed responses given by those endpoints.
